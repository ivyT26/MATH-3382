# Summary of Hypothesis Tests

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  State the hypotheses and identify (from the claim) if it is a one or two-tail test.

2.  Compute the [**test statistic**]{style="color: blue;"}.

    -   The test statistic measures how many standard errors the observed statistic(s) is/are from the null claim.
    -   The farther the observed sample is from the null claim, the more significant the test result will be.

3.  Using the null distribution, compute the [**P-value**]{style="color: blue;"}.

    -   The P-value is the probability of getting a sample with a test statistic as or more extreme than the observed sample assuming $H_0$ is true.
    -   It is the area in the tails(s) beyond the test statistic.
    -   The more "extreme" the observed sample, the smaller the P-value.

4.  Based on the [**significance level**]{style="color: blue;"}, $\alpha$, make a decision to reject or not reject the null hypothesis

    -   If P-value $\leq \alpha$, we reject $H_0$.
    -   If P-value $> \alpha$, we do not reject $H_0$.

5.  Summarize the results in practical terms, **in the context of the problem**.

    -   If we reject $H_0$, this means there is enough evidence to support the claim in $H_a$.
    -   If we do not reject $H_0$, this means there is not evidence to support the claim in $H_a$. The test is inconclusive.

# Hypothesis Tests For a Single Proportion

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Question 1

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Paul the Oracle Octopus](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=12BkB-pS9gVaAgly8YWdqQ6iu63J2w6wo)

In the 2010 World Cup in Germany, Paul the octopus (aka the Oracle Octopus) correctly predicted the correct outcome in all 8 of the matches he predicted.
Paul beat out his rival Mani, Singapore's psychic parakeet, who predicted six matches in a row before missing a prediction.
**Is this evidence that Paul actually has psychic powers?**

### Question 1a

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What would this proportion be if Paul does not have psychic powers?
If he does?
Set up the null and alternative hypotheses in terms of the proportion of all correct guesses an octopus makes.
Use appropriate notation.

#### Solution to Question 1a

------------------------------------------------------------------------

H0: Paul has no special powers.
He's just lucky.

p = 0.5

Ha: Paul has special powers.

p \> 0.5

This is a one tail test , righthanded (?).\

\
\

### Question 1b

------------------------------------------------------------------------

How unusual would this be if Paul was just randomly guessing?
Compute the P-value.

#### Solution to Question 1b

------------------------------------------------------------------------

P value = P(test stat as or more extreme than observed given null hypothesis is true)

X = \# of correct predictions out of 8

Given that null hypothesis is true:

X \~ Binom(8, 0.5) = Null Distribution

We want to know P(X \>= 8)

P(X \>= 8) = (1/2)\^8

approximately 0.0039\
\
Testing for a single proportion uses a binomial distribution.\

### Question 1c

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a 5% significance level is chosen, what is the result?

#### Solution to Question 1c

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The result is that Paul has special powers.\

\
\

# Hypothesis Test for a Single Proportion

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Let** $X$ be a binomial random and let $p_0$ denote the value of $p$ claimed in $H_0$.
If we observe $X=x$ successes out of $n$ trials, then we can find the P-value using a binomial distribution using the assumed probability of success, $p_0$.

# Hypothesis Test for a Single Mean (Known Population Variance)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Question 2

------------------------------------------------------------------------

SAT math scores[^1] in the US in 2017 were normally distributed with a mean of 570 and a standard deviation of 107.
A high school district boasts their students are bright and their students are so good at math they can prove it (using a hypothesis test).
A random sample of 25 seniors are selected, and the mean SAT math score of the sample is 613.

### Question 2a

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set up the null and alternative hypotheses both in words and using appropriate notation.

#### Solution to Question 2a

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   $H_0$: The mean SAT score at this school is equal to 570.
    These students are just as good as any other school.

    -   $\mu = 570$

-   $H_a$: The mean SAT score at this school is above average.

    -   $\mu > 570$

\
\

### Question 2b

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compute the test statistic and interpret the meaning in practical terms.

#### Solution to Question 2b

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The test statistic for this problem would be the sample mean.

Statistical significance is finding evidence that contradicts the null hypothesis and best supports the alternative hypothesis.
The more the statistic contradicts the null hypothesis and best supports the alternative hypothesis, the more significant.\

\
\

### Question 2c

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compute the P-value and interpret the meaning in practical terms.

#### Solution to Question 2c

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\
P(test stat is or as more extreme \| null hypothesis is true)

Use normal distribution (given in problem)

X \~ N(570, 107) \<\-\-- describes a distribution of an individual school

Get normal distribution of all samples using CLT (null distribution):

X bar \~ N(570, 107/sqrt(25))\

P(X bar \>= 613) = 1 - pnorm(613, 570, 107/sqrt(25))\

### Question 2d

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a 5% significance level is chosen, what is the result?
If a 1% significance level is chosen, what is the result?

#### Solution to Question 2d

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\
\
\

## Question 3

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are we getting enough sleep?
It is generally recommended that adults sleep 8 hours per night.
A random sample of 22 students at CU Denver had an average of $7.5$ hours with a standard deviation of $1.7$ hours.
Is this evidence that sleeping patterns of students at CU Denver are different from the recommended amount of sleep?

### Question 3a

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set up the null and alternative hypotheses both in words and using appropriate notation.

#### Solution to Question 3a

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   $H_0$:

    $\mu = 8$

-   $H_a$:

    $\mu \ne 8$

\
\
\

### Question 3b

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compute the test statistic and interpret the meaning in practical terms.

#### Solution to Question 3b

------------------------------------------------------------------------

t = $\frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{SE} = \frac{7.5-8}{\frac{1.7}{\sqrt{22}}} = -1.3797$\
\
\

### Question 3c

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compute the P-value and interpret the meaning in practical terms.

#### Solution to Question 3c

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\
Null distribution to use: t distribution because pop std is unknown

```{r}
p.val <- 2 * (pt(-1.3797,22-1))
p.val
```

### Question 3d

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a 5% significance level is chosen, what is the result?

#### Solution to Question 3d

------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.1822 \> 0.05, therefore it is not statistically significant.
we fail to reject our null hypothesis therefore the rest is inconclusive.\

\
\

# Hypothesis Test for a Single Mean (Unknown Variance)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots , X_n$ be a random sample from a normal population with unknown mean and **unknown standard deviation**.
Let $\mu_0$ denote the value of $\mu$ claimed in $H_0$, then

$$t = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu_0}{\frac{\color{red}{s}}{\sqrt{n}}}.$$

**We use a** [$t$-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom]{style="color: red;"} to compute the corresponding P-value.
