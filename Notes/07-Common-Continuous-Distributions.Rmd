# Continuous Uniform Distribution

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a continuous random variable is [**uniformly distributed**]{style="color: blue;"} on the interval $\lbrack a , b \rbrack$, then

-   The pdf is $\displaystyle f(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \frac{1}{b-a}, & a \leq x \leq b\\ 0, & \mbox{otherwise} \end{array} \right.$.

-   The cdf is

$$F(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 
0, &  x<a \\ 
\frac{x-a}{b-a}, &  a \leq x \leq b \\ 
1,  &  x>b 
\end{array} \right.$$

-   $E(X) = \dfrac{a+b}{2}$; $\mbox{Var}(X) = \dfrac{(b-a)^2}{12}$; Median $=E(X) = \dfrac{a+b}{2}$.

1/b-a comes from: b-a is the length of the rectangle, and we know the total area = 1, rectangle area is (b-a) \* h = 1

# Normal Distributions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many cases where the data tends to be distributed symmetrically around a central value with no bias to the left or right like this[^1]

[**Normal distributions**]{style="color: blue;"} arise in many settings: Heights of people, size of items produced by machines, and most importantly in statistics data sets resulting from many independent random events.

The shape of a normal distribution is determined by two parameters:

-   The [**mean**]{style="color: blue;"}, $\color{blue}{\mu}$, is center of the distribution.
-   The [**standard deviation**]{style="color: blue;"} $\color{blue}{\sigma}$, tells us how wide the distribution is.
-   If $X$ is normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, we write $\color{blue}{\mathbf{X \sim N(\mu, \sigma)}}$.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
x <- seq(-10, 10, length=1000)
stan <- dnorm(x)

std <- c(1, 2, 4)
colors <- c("black", "blue", "red")
labels <- c("sigma=1", "sigma=2", "sigma=4")

plot(x, stan, type="l", lty=2, xlab="x value",
  ylab="Density", main="Comparison of St Dev")

for (i in 1:3){
  lines(x, dnorm(x, 0, std[i]), lwd=2, col=colors[i])
}

legend("topright", inset=.05, title="Distributions",
  labels, lwd=2, lty=1, col=colors)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
x <- seq(-7, 7, length=100)
stan <- dnorm(x)
mu <- c(0, 3)
colors <- c("black", "blue")
labels <- c("mu=0", "mu=3")

plot(x, stan, type="l", lty=2, xlab="x value",
  ylab="Density", main="Comparison of Means")

for (i in 1:2){
  lines(x, dnorm(x, mu[i], 1), lwd=2, col=colors[i])
}

legend("topright", inset=.05, title="Distributions",
  labels, lwd=2, lty=1, col=colors)
```

## Question 1:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

a.  What effect does increasing the standard deviation have on the shape of a normal distribution?

b.  What effect does increasing the mean have on the shape of a normal distribution?

### Solution to Question 1:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

a.  affects the width of the distribution

b.  this translates the distribution to the left or right

## The 68%-95%-99.7% Empirical Rule

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The [**empirical rule**]{style="color: blue;"} for normal distributions:

-   68% of all values fall within one standard deviation (both above and below) from the mean, and
-   95% of all values fall within two standard deviations of the mean.
-   99.7% of all values fall within three standard deviations of the mean.

## Question 2:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Last night, Israel became the first country ever to pass legislation banning the use of 'underweight' models in local ads and publications.
> The new law employs an interesting tactic: Models must prove that their Body Mass Index (BMI) is higher than the World Health Organization's indication of malnourishment (a BMI of 18.5) by producingÂ an up-to-date medical report --- no older than three months --- at all shoots to be used in the Israeli market.[^2]

[^2]: "Israel Passes Law Requiring Models to Show Health Records and Meet Weight Standards", *New York Magazine* by Charlotte Cowles on April 20, 2012

-   Let $X$ denote the BMI of adult men in Israel. We know that $X \sim N(26,4)$.
-   Let $Y$ denote the BMI of adult women in Israel. We know that $Y \sim N(26.5,4.5)$.

X \~ N(mean, std), if they want to mention variance: X \~ N(mean, std\^2)

### Question 2a:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What proportion of the men in Israel have BMI between 26 and 30?

#### Solution to Question 2a:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
68/2
```

34% of men have a BMI between 26 and 30

### Question 2b:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What proportion of the women in Israel have BMI between 22 and 35.5?

#### Solution to Question 2b:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
(95/2) + (68/2)
```

71.25% of women have a BMI between 22 and 35.5

### Question 2c:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

How many standard deviations from the mean is a male BMI of 21?

#### Solution to Question 2c:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A male of BMI of 21 is a little over -1 standard deviations away from the mean.

They are between 1 and 2 standard deviations below the mean.

There are -5 units of BMI between 21 from the mean 26.

-5 BMI units / (4 BMI units / 1 std)

-1.25 std away from the mean (z score)

\
\
\
\

## $Z$-Scores and the Standard Normal Distribution

The number of standard deviations a given data value is from the mean is called the [**z-score**]{style="color: blue;"} for the value and is calculated using the formula

$$\color{blue}{\large z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}}.$$

For example, the $z$-score of a male with a BMI 21 is $z=\frac{21-26}{4} = -1.25$.

![Standardizing a Normal Distribution](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1tyB0O5ZQJkupp8_nKg2mpkcl2xk52_g1)

When you compute the z-score, you are [**"standardizing"**]{style="color: blue;"} your data.
You describe values in terms of how many standard deviations from they are from the mean.
Comparing areas, we see that $P(X<21) = P(Z < -1.25)$.

## Question 3:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

BMI distribution is approximately normal.
In Israel, women have mean BMI of $26.5$ with a standard deviation $4.5$.
What proportion of the women in Israel are legally "underweight" (BMI $< 18.5$)?

### Question 3a:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculate the $z$-score of a Israeli woman with a BMI of $18.5$.

#### Solution to Question 3a:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\
z = 18.5 - 26.5 / 4.5

```{r}
(18.5 - 26.5)/4.5
```

\
\
\

### Question 3b:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interpret the meaning of the value in part (a), and give an estimate for the proportion of women in Israel who are legally underweight.

#### Solution to Question 3b:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\
A person with a BMI of 18.5 is 1.78 standard deviations below the mean.

P(BMI \< 18.5) =\
$$P(\mbox{BMI} < 18.5) = \int_{0}^{18.5} \frac{1}{4.5\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x-26.5}{4.5} \right)^2} \, dx$$

\
\

## A Formula for Normal Distributions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The probability density function for normal distribution (or Gaussian) $X \sim N(\mu,\sigma)$ is given by the formula

$$\color{blue}{\large f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} \right)^2}}.$$

To find the probability that a woman has a BMI less than $18.5$, we could try to evaluate

$$P(\mbox{BMI} < 18.5) = \int_{0}^{18.5} \frac{1}{4.5\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x-26.5}{4.5} \right)^2} \, dx$$

YIKES, good luck with that!
So we need to find other methods.

## Calculating Areas Under Normal Distributions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Question 4:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What proportion of women in Israel are below the $18.5$ BMI limit?

### Solution to Question 4:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Using the standard normal distribution table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Standardizing a Normal Distribution](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1u-Xhx1nn44874feY90TC0Zy6ZeTjKN0b){width="70%"}

standard deviation = -1.78, proportion at this std = 0.0375

```{r}
pnorm(-1.78, 0, 1)
pnorm(18.5, 26.5, 4.5)
#slightly different because of the accuracy of the first one (num decimals)
```

#### Areas Under Normal Distributions with R:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As with other distributions, `p` before distribution name `norm` means `pnorm()` calculates cumulative distribution function for a normal distribution:

-   `pnorm(x, mean, sd)`$=P(X<x)$ gives the area to the left of $x$ under $N(\mu,\sigma)$.
-   `pnorm(x, mean,  sd, lower.tail=FALSE)`$=P(X>x)$ gives the area to the right of $x$ under $N(\mu,\sigma)$.

Or you can find the $z$-score and use the standard normal distribution in R as well:

-   `pnorm(z, 0, 1)`$=P(Z<z)$ gives the area to the left of $x$ under $N(0,1)$.
-   `pnorm(z, 0,  1, lower.tail=FALSE)`$=P(Z>z)$ gives the area to the right of $x$ under $N(0,1)$.

dnorm(x,mean, std) = height at that point, not helpful for this class

## Question 5:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intelligence quotient (IQ) scores are normally distributed.
The mean IQ score is 100 points and the standard deviation is 16 points.

### Question 5a:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What proportion of people have an IQ score above 116?

#### Solution to Question 5a:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
1 - pnorm(116, 100, 16)
```

### Question 5b:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marilyn vos Savant has been known to have the highest recorded IQ in the world.
The $z$-score of her test result is $z=5.4$.
What is her IQ score?

#### Solution to Question 5b:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.4 = (x - 100) / 16

```{r}
(5.4 * 16) + 100
```

### Question 5c:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What proportion of people have an IQ score between 75 and 100?

#### Solution to Question 5c:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 - (P(X \< 75) + P(X \> 100)) or P(X\< 100) - P(X\< 75)

P(X \> 100) = 1 - P(X\<=100)

```{r}
less75 <- pnorm(75, 100, 16)
# less75
big100 = 0.5 #since we know 100 is the mean, and anything less than 100 is 0.5 and anything greater than 100 is 0.5 of the distribution
#pnorm(100, 100, 16) # is the same thing

big100 - less75
```

### Question 5d:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the 90th percentile for IQ?
In other words, find the IQ score such that 90% of the people score less than that score.

#### Solution to Question 5d:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
qnorm(0.9,100,16)
```

### Question 6:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Describe the shape of your graph, and why you believe the graph will have this shape.

\
exponential distribution

(geometric probability distribution)\
\

# Exponential Distributions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Uniform distributions model situations in which each outcome has an equally likely chance to occur.
-   Most people are average height, but there are approximately an equal number of shorter and taller people. This can be modeled using a normal distribution.
-   Most of the time, you do not need to wait very long for the next light rail. But sometimes, though rarely, you do get stuck waiting a longer amount of time.
-   The waiting time for the light rail has properties that can be modeled using an [**exponential distribution**]{style="color: blue;"}.

If a continuous random variable $X$ is [**exponentially distributed**]{style="color: blue;"}, the shape of its pdf depends on one parameter, $\lambda = \dfrac{1}{\mu}$ where $\mu$ denotes the average value of $X$.
We write $X \sim Exp(\lambda)$.

-   The pdf is $\displaystyle f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$ for $x >0$ where $\lambda = \dfrac{1}{\mu}$.

-   $E(X) = \dfrac{1}{\lambda}=\mu$ and $\mbox{Var}(X) = \dfrac{1}{\lambda^2} = \mu^2$.
