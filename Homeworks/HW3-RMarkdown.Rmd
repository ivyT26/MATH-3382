# Question 1:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A total of $n$ people have applied for a job opening.
The $n$ candidates for a job have been ranked $1, 2, 3, \ldots , n$.
Let $X$ equal the rank of a randomly selected candidate, so that $X$ has pdf

$$f_X(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \frac{1}{n} \hspace{10pt} & x=1,2,3, \ldots n \\
  0 & \mbox{otherwise} \end{array} \right. .$$

## Question 1a:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What type of distribution does this random variable have?
(i.e. Binomial, Uniform, Geometric, Poisson) Support your answer with an explanation of why.

### Solution to Question 1a:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This random variable has a uniform distribution.
According to the given piece wise function, there are n choices and each choice has an equal likelihood of occurring.
Out of n candidates total, they each have a 1/n chance of being chosen.
For example, if there were 3 candidates, then each candidate would have a 1/3 chance of being chosen.\

## Question 1b:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compute $E(X)$.
*Hint: You may using a "shortcut formula"*.

### Solution to Question 1b:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

$$
E(X) = (1 * \frac{1}{n}) + (2 * \frac{1}{n}) + (3 * \frac{1}{n}) + ... + (n * \frac{1}{n}) =>
$$

$$
E(X) = \frac{1}{n}(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n) => 
$$

$$
E(X) = \frac{n+1}{2}
$$

## Question 1c:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compute $\mbox{Var(X)}$.
*Hint: You may using a "shortcut formula"*.

### Solution to Question 1c:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

$$
Var(X) = E(X^2) - E(X)^2 => 
$$\

$$
Var(X) = [\frac{1}{n}(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + n^2)] - (\frac{n+1}{2})^2 =>
$$\

$$
Var(X) = (\frac{2n^2+3n+1}{6}) - (\frac{n^2+2n+1}{4}) =>
$$

$$
Var(X) = \frac{n^2-1}{12}
$$

# Question 2:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suppose that 35% of all students who want to buy a text for a particular course want a new copy (the successes for the bookstore), whereas the other 65% want a used copy.
Consider randomly selecting 25 purchasers.

## Question 2a:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the expected value and variance for the number of students (out of 25) who want a new copy of the book?

### Solution to Question 2a:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Provide your supporting work below.

This study is a binomial distribution.
There are only two options presented: some students want to purchase a new copy while others want a used copy.

$E(X) = np$

$Var(X) = npq$

```{r}
ex <- 25 * 0.35
var <- 25 * 0.35 * 0.65
ex
var
```

The expected value for the number of students who want a new copy of the book is 8.75.

The variance for the number of students who want a new copy of the book is 5.6875.

## Question 2b:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The bookstore has 15 new copies and 15 used copies in stock.
If 25 people come in one by one to purchase this text, what is the probability that all 25 will get the type of book they want from current stock?
*Hint: Let* $X$ be the number who want a new copy.
For what values of $X$ will all 25 get what they want?

### Solution to Question 2b:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Provide your supporting work below.

The possibilities where all 25 students may get the books they want are when X = 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

X cannot be between 0 and 9.
For example, if 9 people wanted new copies, then 25-9 =16 people would want used copies and there would not be enough used copies in stock to satisfy this group of 25 students.
X cannot be between 16 and 25 because for a similar scenario above.
For example, if 16 people wanted new copies, then there would not be enough copies to satisfy the students who want new books in that group of 25 students.

The probability of all 25 students getting the book they want is adding up all the possibilities that in each scenario they will get what they want.

We can use the probability mass function formula to get the probability of each scenario:

$$f(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
\left( \begin{array}{c} n\\ x \end{array} \right) p^x(1-p)^{n-x} & \mbox{for } x =0,1,2, \ldots , n \\
0 & \mbox{otherwise} 
\end{array} \right. $$

```{r}
prob_satisfy <- 0
for (x in 10:15){
  # print(dbinom(x, 25, 0.35))
  prob_satisfy <- prob_satisfy + dbinom(x, 25, 0.35)
}
prob_satisfy
pbinom(15, 25, 0.35) - pbinom(9, 25, 0.35) #another way to get the probability that X >= 10 and X <=15 is P(X <= 15) - P(X <= 9)
```

The probability that all 25 students will get the book they want with the current stock is 0.3667529.

## Question 2c:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suppose that new copies cost $\$100$ and used copies cost $\$70$.
Assume the bookstore has $50$ new copies and $50$ used copies.
What is the expected value of total revenue from the sale of the next $25$ copies purchased?
*Hint: Let* $h(X) =$ the revenue when $X$ of the $25$ purchasers want new copies.
Express this as a linear function.

### Solution to Question 2c:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Provide your supporting work below.

The bookstore has enough in stock to satisfy all possibilities (if 25 students wanted new copies then the bookstore can provide for the demand).

total revenue = 100 \* (number of new copies sold) + 70 \* (number of old copies sold)

h(x) = 100x+ 70(25-x), where x is the number of new copies sold

E(h(x)) = E(30x + 1750)

E(h(x)) = (30 \* E(X)) + 1750

```{r}
ex <- 25 * 0.35 #expected number of people who would want new copies about of 25 students
(30 * ex) + 1750
```

The expected value of the total revenue from the sale of the next 25 copies purchased is 2012.5.

# Question 3:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suppose small aircraft arrive at an airport according to a Poisson distribution with rate $\lambda = 7$ air craft per hour, so that the number of arrivals during a time period of $t$ hours is a Poisson random variable with parameter $\mu(t) =7t$.

## Question 3a:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the probability that:

i.  Exactly 5 small aircraft arrive during a **1 hour period**?
ii. At most 5 small aircraft arrive during a **2 hour period**?
iii. At least 7 small aircraft arrive during a **1 hour period**?
iv. What is the probability that at least 25 small aircraft arrive during a **3 hour period**?

### Solution to Question 3a:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Answer each question by entering an appropriate line of R code in the code cell below.
No need to interpret your output further.

```{r}
# Probability that exactly 5 small aircraft arrive during a 1 hour period?
# Enter code for 3a part i below
dpois(5, 7)

# Probability that at most 5 small aircraft arrive during a 2 hour period?
# Enter code for 3a part ii below
ppois(5, 14) #if want during a 2 hour period, double lambda

# Probability that at least 7 small aircraft arrive during a 1 hour period?
# Enter code for 3a part iii below
1 - ppois(6, 7) #1 - at most 6 aircrafts per hour

# Probability that at least 25 small aircraft arrive during a 3 hour period?
# Enter code for 3a part iv below
1 - ppois(24, 21) #1 - at most 24 aircrafts per 3 hours
```

## Question 3b

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the expected value and standard deviation of the number of small aircraft that arrive during a 90 min period?

### Solution to Question 3b:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Provide your supporting work below.

$$
E(X) = \lambda
$$\
E(X) = 7 \* 1.5

```{r}
expected_value <- 7 * 1.5
expected_value
std <- sqrt(expected_value) #the value for expected value and variance are the same for poisson distribution, and standard deviation is the square root of variance
std
```

The expected value of the number of aircraft that arrive in a 90 minute period is 10.5.

Variance = standard deviation \^ 2, and variance is the same as E(X).

The standard deviation of the number of aircraft that arrive during a 90 minute period is 3.24037.\

# Question 4:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A carnival game consists of spinning a wheel with $10$ slots, eight red and two blue.
If you land on the blue slot, you win a prize.
Suppose your younger brother really wants the prize, so you will play until you win.

## Question 4a:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the probability you'll win on the first spin (i.e. no failures before first success)?

### Solution to Question 4a:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enter R code in the cell below to compute the probability.\

```{r}
# Enter code answer question 4a
dgeom(0, 2/10) #2/10 is the probability of landing on a blue slot to win
```

The probability of winning on the first spin is 0.2.

## Question 4b:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the probability you'll require exactly 4 spins to win?

### Solution to Question 4b:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enter R code in the cell below to compute the probability.\

```{r}
# Enter code answer question 4b
dgeom(3, 2/10) #exactly 3 failures before 1st success
```

The probability of winning on the 4th spin is 0.1024.

## Question 4c:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the probability you'll require at most 4 spins?

### Solution to Question 4c:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enter R code in the cell below to compute the probability.\

```{r}
# Enter code answer question 4c
pgeom(3, 2/10) #at most 3 spins before first success
```

The probability of winning with at most 4 spins is 0.5904.

## Question 4d:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the expected number of spins required for you to win the prize, and what is the corresponding variance?

### Solution to Question 4d:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enter R code in the cell below to compute the probability.\

$$
E(X) = \frac{q}{p}, \ Var(X) = \frac{q}{p^2}
$$

```{r}
# Enter code answer question 4d
q <- 8/10
p <- 2/10
ex <- q / p
variance <- q / (p^2)
ex
variance
```

The expected number of spins required to win the prize is 4.
The variance is 20.

# Question 5:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The current in a certain circuit as measured by an ammeter is a continuous random variable $X$ with the following probability distribution function:

$$f(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 0.01x+0.21  \ \ \ \ & 2 \leq x \leq 6\\
  0 & \mbox{otherwise} \end{array} \right. .$$

## Question 5a: (not collected) {#question-5a-not-collected}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

On a separate piece of paper that should not submit, sketch a graph of the pdf $f(x)$.
This is for your practice, not collected.

### Solution to Question 5a:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do not submit your work.

```{r}
x <- 2:6
plot(x, (0.01*x)+0.21, xlab = "x", ylab = "f(x)", type = "l", col="red")
```

![](images/paste-73698A41.png){width="591"}

## Question 5b:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculate $P(X \leq 3)$.
Be sure to provide supporting work.

-   For practice mark this value on the graph you sketched in [Question 5a: (not collected)](#question-5a-not-collected) .

### Solution to Question 5b:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Be sure to provide all supporting work for how you calculate $P(X \leq 3)$.

![](images/paste-9054C91E.png){width="342"}\
pdf function: f(x) = 0.01x + 0.21

pdf is the derivative of cdf.

\
$P(X \leq 3) = P(2 \leq X \leq 3)$\

$P(2 \leq X \leq 3) = \int_{2}^3 0.01t+0.21 \, dt = \frac{0.01t^2}{2} + 0.21t \ |_2^3$

$P(2 \leq X \leq 3) = {0.005(3^2)} + 0.21(3) - ({0.005(3^2)} + 0.21(2))$

```{r}
lessthan3 <- (((0.005 * 3^2)) + (0.21 * 3)) - (((0.005*2^2))  + (0.21*2))
lessthan3
```

The probability that X is less than or equal to 3 is 0.235.

## Question 5c:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set up and evaluate an integral to compute the expected value, $E(X)$.
Be sure to provide supporting work.

### Solution to Question 5c:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Be sure to provide all supporting work.

$$E(X) = \mu = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \cdot f(x) \, dx.$$

$$E(X) = \int_{2}^{6} x \cdot (0.01x+0.21) \, dx.$$

$$E(X) = \int_{2}^{6} (0.01x^2+0.21x) \, dx.$$\
$$E(X) = \frac{0.01x^3}{3} + \frac{0.21x^2}{2}|_2^6$$

$$E(X) = (\frac{0.01(6)^3}{3} + \frac{0.21(6)^2}{2}) - (\frac{0.01(2)^3}{3} + \frac{0.21(2)^2}{2})$$

```{r}
x6 <- ((0.01 * 6**3) / 3) +  ((0.21 * 6**2) / 2)
x2 <- ((0.01 * 2**3) / 3) +  ((0.21 * 2**2) / 2)
ex <- x6 - x2
ex
```

The expected value is 4.053333.

## Question 5d:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Find a formula for the cumulative distribution function (cdf), $F(x)$.
Be sure to provide supporting work.

### Solution to Question 5d:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Be sure to provide all supporting work.

pdf is the derivative of cdf.
The range of valid values of x was also given at the beginning of the problem, which was between 2 and 6.
If values are over 1, they will be automatically changed to 1.
When calculating the function with X = 5 and X = 6, the values were over 1, whereas the highest valid X value that was not over 1 was X = 4, hence the range for the function is between 2 and 5(exclusive) instead of 2 and 6 (see work in 5e).
The range of F(x) should be between 0 and 1.

$F(x) = \int_{0}^x 0.01t+0.21 \, dt = \frac{0.01t^2}{2} + 0.21t|_0^x$

$$
F(X) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 0 & \mbox{x < 2}\\
{0.005x^2}+0.21x  \ \ \ \ & 2 \leq x < 5\\
  1 & x \geq 5 \end{array} \right.
$$\
\

```{r}
for (x in 2:6) {
  print((0.005 * x**2) + 0.21*x)
}
```

## Question 5e: (not collected) {#question-5e-not-collected}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

On a separate piece of paper that should not submitted, sketch a graph of the cdf $F(x)$ you found in [Question 5d:].
This is for your practice, not collected.

### Solution to Question 5e:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do not submit your work.

```{r}
x <- 2:6
plot(x, (0.005*x**2)+(0.21*x), xlab = "x", ylab = "f(x)", type = "l", col="red")
```

![](images/paste-86FEF3B2.png)

## Question 5f:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculate the median value of $X$.
Be sure to provide supporting work.

-   For practice mark this value on the graph you sketched in [Question 5e: (not collected)](#question-5e-not-collected) .

### Solution to Question 5f:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Be sure to provide all supporting work for how you calculate the median.

![](images/paste-8E5826CD.png){width="375"}

\
$Median => F(X) = 0.5$

$F(X) = 0.005x^2 + 0.21x = 0.5$

$0.005x^2 + 0.21x - 0.5 = 0$

$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$\
\
$x = \frac{-0.21 \pm \sqrt{0.21^2-4*0.005*(-0.5)}}{2*0.005}$

```{r}
denominatorf <- 2 * 0.005
numerator2f <- sqrt(0.21**2-(4*0.005*(-0.5)))
numerator1f <- -0.21
x1f <- (numerator1f - numerator2f) / denominatorf
x2f <- (numerator1f + numerator2f) / denominatorf
x1f
x2f
```

x2f is positive and within the range of x, so the median value of X is 2.259407.

## Question 5g:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculate the 75th percentile of $X$.
Be sure to provide supporting work.

### Solution to Question 5g:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Be sure to provide all supporting work for how you calculate the the 75th percentile of $X$.

\
The 75th percentile of X is when F(X) = 0.75

$F(X) = 0.005x^2 + 0.21x - 0.75 = 0$

$x = \frac{-0.21 \pm \sqrt{0.21^2-4*0.005*(-0.75)}}{2*0.005}$\

```{r}
denominatorg <- 2 * 0.005
numerator2g <- sqrt(0.21**2-(4*0.005*(-0.75)))
numerator1g <- -0.21
x1g <- (numerator1g - numerator2g) / denominatorg
x2g <- (numerator1g + numerator2g) / denominatorg
x1g
x2g
```

x2g is positive and is within the range of x, so the 75th percentile value of X is 3.310492.

# Question 6:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The variance of a continuous random variable $X$, with pdf $f(x)$ , is defined as

$$\mbox{Var} (X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \bigg( (x-\mu)^2 \cdot f(x) \bigg) \, dx ,$$ where $\mu=E(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \cdot f(x) \, dx$ is the expected value of $X$.

Prove that $$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \bigg( (x-\mu)^2 \cdot f(x) \bigg) \, dx = E(X^2) - (E(X))^2.$$

Answer with insufficient or missing supporting work may not earn full credit.

$E(X^2) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2f(x) \, dx$

$f(x) = (0.01x+0.21), \ 2 \ \leq x \leq \ 6$\

$E(X^2) = \int_{2}^{6} x^2 \cdot (0.01x+0.21) \, dx$\

$E(X^2) = \int_{2}^{6} \ (0.01x^3+0.21x^2) \, dx$

$E(X^2) =\frac{0.01x^4}{4} + \frac{0.21x^3}{3} \ |_2^6$

$E(X^2) = 0.0025x^4 + 0.07x^3 \ |_2^6$

```{r}
x6a <- (0.0025 * 6**4) + (0.07 * 6**3)
x2a <- (0.0025 * 2**4) + (0.07 * 2**3)
ex2 <- x6a - x2a
ex2
```

The value of E(X^2^) is 17.76.

## Question 7b:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the formula you derived in [Question 5:] for $E(X)$, the shortcut for $\mbox{Var}(X)$ in [Question 6:], and your answer to [Question 7a:], calculate the value of $\mbox{Var}(X)$.

### Solution to Question 7b:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Answer with insufficient or missing supporting work may not earn full credit.
You should connect solutions from previous questions.

from question 5c, value of E(X) = 4.053333:

```{r}
x6 <- ((0.01 * 6**3) / 3) +  ((0.21 * 6**2) / 2)
x2 <- ((0.01 * 2**3) / 3) +  ((0.21 * 2**2) / 2)
ex <- x6 - x2
ex
```

from question 7a, value of E(X^2^) = 17.76:

```{r}
x6a <- (0.0025 * 6**4) + (0.07 * 6**3)
x2a <- (0.0025 * 2**4) + (0.07 * 2**3)
ex2 <- x6a - x2a
ex2
```

$Var(X) = E(X^2) - \big( E(X) \big)^2$

```{r}
var7b <- ex2 - (ex**2)
var7b
```

The variance of X is 1.330489.

# Question 8:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let $X$ denote the amount of time (in hours) that a car remains parked after paying a parking meter for a maximum of 2 hours.
For example $x=0.5$ means a car was parked for a half-hour and then left.
$x=2$ means a car uses the spot for the full 2 hours.
The cumulative distribution function (cdf) for $X$ is:

$$ F(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 0  \ \ & x < 0 \\ \frac{x^2}{4} & 0 \leq x < 2 \\ 1 & x \geq 2 \end{array} \right. .$$

## Question 8a:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compute $P(X<0)$.
Show your supporting work below.

### Solution to Question 8a:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Be sure to provide all supporting work.

$P(X < 0) = F(0)$

$F(0) = \frac{0^2}{4} = 0$\

The probability that random variable X \< 0 is 0.\

\

## Question 8b:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compute $P(.5 \leq X \leq 1)$.
Show your supporting work below.

### Solution to Question 8b:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Be sure to provide all supporting work.

$P(0.5 \leq X \leq 1) = F(1) - F(0.5)$

$F(1) = \frac{1^2}{4} = \frac{1}{4}$

$F(0.5) = \frac{0.5^2}{4} = \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{16}$

$P(0.5 \leq X \leq 1) = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{16} = \frac{4}{16} - \frac{1}{16} = \frac{3}{16}$\

```{r}
3/16
```

The probability that random variable X is between 0.5 and 1 is $\frac{3}{16}$ or 0.1875.\

## Question 8c:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compute $P(X > 1.5)$.
Show your supporting work below.

### Solution to Question 8c:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Be sure to provide all supporting work.

$P(X > 1.5) = 1 - P(X \leq 1.5)$

$P(X \leq 1.5) = F(1.5) = \frac{1.5^2}{4} = \frac{2.25}{4} = 0.5625$\

```{r}
lessthan1_5 <-(1.5**2)/4
greaterthan1_5 <- 1 - lessthan1_5
greaterthan1_5
```

$P(X > 1.5) = 1 - 0.5625 = 0.4375$

The probability that random variable X is greater than 1.5 is 0.4375.

## Question 8d:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Find the median value of $X$.
Show your supporting work below.

### Solution to Question 8d:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Be sure to provide all supporting work.

$Median => F(X) = 0.5$

$\frac{x^2}{4} = 0.5$

$x^2 = 2$

$x = \pm \sqrt{2}$\

```{r}
0.5 * 4
sqrt(2)
```

Median must be positive.
The median value of X is 1.414214 or $\sqrt{2}$.

## Question 8e:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Give a formula for $f(x)$, the probability distribution function (pdf) of $X$.
Show your supporting work below.

### Solution to Question 8e:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Be sure to provide all supporting work.

\
pdf is the derivative of cdf, so to get pdf from cdf, take the derivative of the cdf formula.

$pdf = \frac{d}{dx} \frac{x^2}{4}$

$pdf = \frac{2x}{4} = \frac{x}{2}$

$f(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \frac{x}{2} & 0 \leq x \leq 2 \\ 0 & otherwise \end{array} \right.$

## Question 8f:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compute $E(X)$.
Show your supporting work below.

### Solution to Question 8f:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Be sure to provide all supporting work.

$E(X) = \int_{0}^{2} xf(x) \, dx$

\
$E(X) = \int_0^2 x \cdot \frac{x}{2} \ dx = \int_0^2 \frac{x^2}{2} \ dx$\

$E(X) = \frac{x^3}{6} \ |_0^2$

$E(X) = \frac{2^3}{6} - \frac{0^3}{6}$

```{r}
(2**3)/6
```

The expected value is 1.333333 or $\frac{3}{2}$.
